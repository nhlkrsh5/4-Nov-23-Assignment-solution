4.What is purpose of declairing variables in javascript,and how do you declare them using the 'let' key word
ANS:
	let keyword is also used for variable declaration. But the only difference is the variable declared with the “let” keyword is block-scoped and local variable. A variable declared with let will be out of scope outside the block within which it has been declared.

Syntex:
	let  variables_name;

Example:	
	let  username
